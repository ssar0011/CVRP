# CVRP
**Overview**
The capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) is a VRP in which vehicles with limited carrying capacity need to pick up or deliver items at various locations. The items have a quantity, such as weight or volume, and the vehicles have a maximum capacity that they can carry. The problem is to pick up or deliver the items for the least cost, while never exceeding the capacity of the vehicles.
